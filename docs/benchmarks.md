# Benchmarks

Benchmarking is the process through which you can scientifically measure the impact of changes on your system.

A large amount of benchmark data is crucial to ensuring that mastercomfig works on various systems.

Thus, it's highly appreciated to benchmark mastercomfig and any changes you make to it or your system, so we can better understand the impact of these.

## How to benchmark

1. Download the [`sbmrk24` 24-player benchmark file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xbuiBnZb301EXFyYuQP17KS21AWM_v5o/view) by shounic.
2. Move it to the `tf/` folder.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enter `timedemo sbmrk24`
5. Record your timedemo output from the console `X frames X seconds X fps (X ms/f) X fps variability`.
6. Repeat `timedemo sbmrk24` as many times as you like to decrease the effects of systemic variation.

## Benchmark data

mastercomfig provides a service for recording benchmark data so that we can improve it together based on data.
